## Project History

### Background
This application was created as part of the Verizon-Pivotal partnership to provide a centralized catalog of cloud-native webinars. The webinars were designed to educate Verizon teams on Pivotal's cloud-native technologies and best practices.

### Evolution
The application appears to have evolved from a previous credit card transaction example (as evidenced by commented code in the HTML template) to its current purpose as a webinar catalog. This demonstrates the flexibility of the Spring Boot framework for rapid application development and repurposing.

### Technology Choices
- **Spring Boot 1.4.1**: Chosen for rapid development and auto-configuration
- **Thymeleaf**: Selected for server-side templating and Spring integration
- **Cloud Foundry**: Chosen as the deployment platform for enterprise-grade hosting
- **Static Content**: Initial implementation uses static data for simplicity

## Future Roadmap

## Migration Notes

### From Static to Dynamic Content
When migrating from static to dynamic content:
1. Implement data model for webinars and presenters
2. Create repository layer for data access
3. Update controller to use service layer
4. Modify templates to use dynamic data
5. Add admin interface for content management

### Database Schema Considerations
Future database implementation should consider:
- Webinar entity (id, title, date, description, recording_url)
- Presenter entity (id, name, bio, profile_url)
- Category entity for organizing webinars
- Many-to-many relationship between webinars and presenters

### API Design Considerations
Future API should follow RESTful principles:
- GET /api/webinars - List all webinars
- GET /api/webinars/{id} - Get specific webinar
- GET /api/presenters - List all presenters
- GET /api/presenters/{id} - Get specific presenter
- Implement proper HTTP status codes and error handling
